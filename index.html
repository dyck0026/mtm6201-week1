        <p>Rajah is a very sweet cat, who loves anyone who will pet him. He is very well-behaved, and very food-motivated. Rajah is a gentle boy, and rarely, if ever, bites people. He doesn't play very much, but enjoys lounging on our porch in the sun. </p>

            <dd>He is a mix of multiple breeds, but due to how floppy he is when picked up, I suspect he is part ragdoll!</dd>
